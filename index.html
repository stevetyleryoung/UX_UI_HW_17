                Crafting Stories Through Purposeful Creation</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="info-block">
            <h3>A little on my past</h3>
            <p>Up until now I have been a self-taught filmmaker (cinematographer, producer, director, editor) and have worked tirelessly to develop an expertise from a fundamental belief that great stories have the power to heal, liberate, educate, and entertain. Throughout my filmmaking career, I aimed to illustrate that through film we can discover a connection to something more profound than our own perspective, and as such my work showcases the lifeblood of our shared human condition.</p>

        <div class="info-block">
            <h3>At the present</h3>
            <p>So, why move to Product Design? Hear me out...Creative diversity and career growth. After years in the filmmaking industry, I want to explore other creative outlets and challenge myself in new ways. With my interest in human behavior and psychology, I am attracted to the user-centered and the purposeful design approach of product design. Career growth. Product design offers a clear career progression path, with opportunities to move up the ranks as a designer, senior designer, design manager, and so on. Transferable skills. After completing a UX/UI bootcamp with Monash University, I believe that the skills and experiences gained in filmmaking can be valuable assets in the world of product design. These include storytelling, interviewing, visual communication, and an understanding of how to create compelling narratives. When intertwined with design thinking, these transferable skills diversify and enhance my design process to create more purposeful, human-centered experiences.</p>

            <h3>To get to the future</h3>
            <p>My career goals involve a continuous journey of growth and development as a product designer, with the ultimate aim of becoming a Creative Director. This path will require a combination of skill-building, leadership development, strategic thinking, and a commitment to creative excellence.</p>
